MNTN Figma file to React website.

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
This is a responsive landing page I built using React and Tailwind CSS, based on the MNTN Figma design. I used this as a front-end practice project to improve my skills in building clean, responsive layouts from a design file.

The entire layout was recreated using plain React (without any frameworks like Vite or Next.js), styled with Tailwind, and made fully mobile-friendly.

ðŸ”§ Tech Stack:
React
Tailwind CSS
Mobile Responsive Design
Deployed on GitHub Pages

This was a fun challenge and a great learning experience!
Feel free to explore the code, give feedback, or use it as inspiration for your own projects.
